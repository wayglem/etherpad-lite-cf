## Using database

 1. Create a database service which have an uri, the name must follow this regex: `/.*(db|database|pg|postgres|mysql|mongo|lite|level|dirty|redis|couch|elasticsearch).*/i`
 2. Bind your service to your app `cf bind-service <app> <service name>`
 3. you need to... No that's all, push your app :)
 
## Using LDAP from user provided service
Ldap plugin is erroring with new etherpad-lite, currently moved this into the branch "cloudfoundry-with-ldap" (or see directly here: https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/etherpad-lite-cf/tree/cloudfoundry-with-ldap#using-ldap-from-user-provided-service)

## Current limitation

* etherpad-lite does not support being instanciated as a cluster. Prefer a single instance `-i 1` in your Cf push. This implies that unplanned maintenances of instances crash won't be transparent to etherpad-lite users

## Note
This version can be runned offline (with no access to internet) if you don't add any plugin in `package.json`
